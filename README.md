# git-open

Type less and open repo webpages faster all from your terminal.

`git-open` is a commandline utility that allows you to specify a repo name
and optionally the author and will then open the matching resource in your
web-browser.

## Usage

Requires the name of the repo that you want to open. You can optionally specify
the user that owns the repo. If you don't pass in a user name it will fall back
to what you've specified for `$GITHUB_USER` and if that is not set it will fall
back to your entry for `git config --get github.user`. (You'd probably have this
set if you're interested in this script after all!)

For example, if you want to open up repo `bar` for Github author `foo`, you'd run:

    $ git-open foo bar

which will open your web-browser to the given user's repo.

If, on the other hand, you've configured your local git to include a github
section and your username is set to `baz` and you want to open your `bar` repo:

    $ git-open foo # defaults to `baz` for author name

## Installation

You can clone the repo into `~/src` and symlink to `~/bin` and use it anywhere:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jeffreyiacono/git-open.git ~/src/git-open
    $ ln -s ~/src/git-open/git-open.sh ~/bin/git-open
    $ git-open -h
    # Usage: /Users/username/bin/git-open [user name] <repo name>
    # Note: user name will default to $GITHUB_USER or your `git config --get github.user` entry.

And make sure `~/bin` is in your `PATH`.

## I'm using Github Enterprise!

Well lucky you. Nice to see that you work for a company that can shell for it!
In this case just set `GITHUB_URL` in your shell and the script will default to
this value.

For example, if your company hosts its github install at `git.my-company.com`,
include this in your `~/.bashrc.local` (or where ever you'd like):

    export GITHUB_URL='https://git.my-company.com'

## I need to customize my default username

Again, we've got you covered: just set `GITHUB_USER` and the script will default
to this value. If it is not set, we try to pull out what you've configured
Github to use (via `git config --get github.user`). Use the same pattern as
above to make your desired username available to the script.
